   <summary><b>Pulling upstream changes from <a href="https://github.com/engineerkit/engineerkit">engineerkit/engineerkit</a> into your private fork</b></summary><br/>

  While we always promote sharing with the open-source community, some companies might find it necessary to privately fork EngineerKit if they have some software engineering standards they want to keep to themselves. Here's a quick guide on how to do this with EngineerKit:

  - First clone down your private repo
  - To add a new remote to your local repo connected to the `engineerkit/engineerkit` repo, run
    ```
    git remote add public git@github.com:engineerkit/engineerkit.git
    ``` 
  - To create a branch where you'll pull changes into, run
    ```
    git checkout -b add_awesome_new_topics
    ```
  - To pull down changes into your new branch, run
    ```
    git pull public main
    ```
  - Resolve any merge conflicts
  - To push up your changes to your private fork, run
    ```
    git push
    ```
