- **Average recommended team composition**
  - Product Manager - 1
  - Product Designer - 1
  - Software Developer - 2-4
- **Communication Channel Equation**: (N*(N-1)) / 2)
  - "N" = The number of members on a team
  - The fewer team members the fewer communication channels and time spent staying coordinated on effort

**Responsibility of product team "manager" roles:**
- **Project Manager** - The owners of a discrete project and its scope, schedule, and budget.
- **Product Owner** - Typically affiliated with Scrum environments, this role owns the conversion of a "business problem to solve" into tasks a product team can execute
- **Product Manager** - This role, acting like a "mini-CEO" of a product, creates and owns product vision and strategy, and acts as the crossroads of all business functions in delivering product to the market
  - The real difference comes down to how much ownership and authority they're given over scope, quality, and budget
- Other titles you may may come across
  - Agile Project Manager 
  - Program Manager
  - Portfolio Manager
  - Director/VP of Product
  - CPO/CTO

**What a developer should expect out of their product manager:**
- **Project Vision** - What future are we creating for our customers with this product?
- **Product Strategy** - What milestones do we need to achieve to accomplish the product vision?
- **Product Release Plan** - What strategic goals need to be accomplished in the next scheduled product release?
- **Product Increment Goal** - What incremental goal toward the release should be focused on next?

**What a product manager expects of a their software developers:**
- **Product Strategy Feasibility** - Is our team(s) capable of accomplishing these milestones? Do we have the right skills? Technology? Is the sequence right?
- **Product Release Plan Feasibility** - Is our team(s) capable of accomplishing these "epics"/features? How large is the relative effort for each? Is there enough margin in place for unknowns and maintenance?
- **Product Increment Feasibility** - Is our team capable of accomplishing these "stories"/features? Which of these tasks can you commit to completing in the next iteration?
- **Keeping Promises** - Did you accomplish what you committed to completing? Does it meet the "definition of done" we agree to?
